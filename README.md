# Milestone-3-Interactive-Data-project


 I was able to analyze fully the datasets I have collected and explore ways to visualize them using Plotly. I am particularly interested in creating engaging and interactive plots to present my data and display it on my website. Although I am uncertain if I can accomplish this goal, I donâ€™t want to overestimate my abilities and poor data visualization skills. 
Overall, I am enthusiastic about the potential of my project and the new skills I will develop throughout the rest of the semester. I look forward to continuing my exploration of the US Tech industry, uncovering new insights and discoveries, and presenting them in innovative and engaging ways.
